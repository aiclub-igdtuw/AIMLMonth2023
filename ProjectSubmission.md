Summary(Optional) :   <  In this project, we analyzed the ESRB ratings of video games using a dataset. We calculated the distribution of ratings, showing how many games fell into each rating category (E, ET, T, M). We visualized the distribution using a bar plot. Next, we focused on the content features of the games and created binary indicator variables to represent the presence or absence of violence, sexual content, language, and drug reference. We calculated the frequency of content feature combinations for each rating category, allowing us to identify patterns and relationships. By analyzing the data, we gained insights into the relationship between ESRB ratings and content features, which can help in understanding how different aspects of games contribute to their assigned ratings.  >
