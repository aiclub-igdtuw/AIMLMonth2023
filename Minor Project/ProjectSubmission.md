Summary(Optional) :   The Iris Dataset contains four features (length and width of sepals and petals) of 50 samples of three species
                      of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and 
                      Iris versicolor). These measures were used to create a linear discriminant model to classify the species.
                      By using different algorithims, we have predicted the Accuracy of this model.
