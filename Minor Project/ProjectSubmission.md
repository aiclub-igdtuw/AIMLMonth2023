Project Title     :   Powerball lottery winning numbers

Google Colab Link :   https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14j7vr7jdUDLyXfampYCxA9UImsUvx2vL?usp=sharing

Summary(Optional) :  Visualisation of frequency trends in winning numbers through bar plot, heat map showing correlation between multipliers and winning numbers

I used LSTM(Time series Analysis model) thought it was not taught in the class along with fine tuning until project submission but got accuracy of 99%
Linear regression model to predict the luckiest number .

Also used Random Forest classifier model(not taught in class) to make predictions but both have low accuracy because of random nature of powerball datasets. 
Both models are solution for second task of project.

Result:Powerball dataset predictions cannot be made with high accuracy as they don't follow a particular pattern or trend.
