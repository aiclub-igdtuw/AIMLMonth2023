Summary(Optional) :  In this project we have analayzed that how the joint of the robotic manipulator relates to the x,y,z coordinates relates to it and also how Inverse kinematics of robotic manipulators can be complex to determine analitically. Inverse kinematics are extremelly important, as they allow us to determine the position of the robot joints needed to position the robot end-effector at a certain point in space. But, direct kinematics are much simpler to determine.The values x, y, and z are calculated based on the direct kinematics model obtained through Denavit-Hartenberg operation.However,this project helps to get hand on experience on differents plots,standardization ,normalization and training model.
