Summary(Optional) :   The project begins by analyzing the distribution of ESRB ratings in the dataset. A bar plot is created to visualize the number of games falling into each rating category (E, ET, T, M).The project explores if specific ESRB content features are more prevalent in certain rating categories. The frequency of each content feature is analyzed for different ESRB ratings using bar plots.The project investigates the correlation between the presence of certain content features and the assigned ESRB rating. A correlation matrix heatmap is generated to visualize the correlation between content features and ESRB ratings.The project investigates the correlation between the presence of certain content features and the assigned ESRB rating. A correlation matrix heatmap is generated to visualize the correlation between content features and ESRB ratings.The project builds a classification model to predict the ESRB rating based on the available features. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and a Random Forest classifier is trained. The model's performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as classification report and confusion matrix.The project leverages libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and utilizes Google Colab for coding and analysis. It provides insights into the distribution of ESRB ratings, the prevalence of content features for different ratings, correlation analysis, and classification modeling to predict ESRB ratings.
