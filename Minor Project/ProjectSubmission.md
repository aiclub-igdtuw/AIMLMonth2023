Summary(Optional) :  My project centers around the meticulous analysis of data captured by cardiotocography (CTG) devices, aiming to prevent childbirth-related deaths through accurate data examination and appropriate interventions. By employing advanced analytical methodologies, I seek to derive valuable insights from the CTG data, ultimately contributing to the preservation of life and well-being during the birthing process. This endeavor entails sophisticated techniques for unraveling intricate patterns, identifying significant trends, and empowering healthcare professionals to make informed decisions. The overarching goal is to proactively address risks and complications, ensuring optimal safety for both mothers and infants.
