Summary(Optional) : The project utilizes machine learning techniques to train the AI model. The model is fed a large dataset of labeled mushroom images, where each image is associated with its corresponding species. The dataset includes a wide range of mushroom species, capturing variations in color, shape, texture, and other relevant features. The model goes through multiple iterations of training, validation, and fine-tuning to optimize its performance. This process involves adjusting the model's parameters and algorithms to improve its accuracy in identifying and classifying mushrooms correctly. The project's main objective is to provide a user-friendly and reliable tool for mushroom enthusiasts, foragers, and even researchers who need assistance in accurately identifying mushroom species. It can help promote safety in mushroom consumption and enhance knowledge about various mushroom species.
