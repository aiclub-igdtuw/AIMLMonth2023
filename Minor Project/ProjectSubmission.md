Summary(Optional) :  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The dataset is explored to understand the distribution and relationships between different variables. EDA involves examining the missing values, analyzing the distribution of the stroke variable, and investigating the correlations between features and the presence of a stroke.

Data Preprocessing: Missing values in the dataset are handled using techniques such as imputation or removal, depending on the nature and amount of missing data. Categorical variables are encoded or transformed to numerical form for model compatibility.

Splitting the Dataset: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using an 80:20 ratio. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is kept aside for evaluating the model's performance on unseen data.

Model Selection: Various machine learning algorithms are considered for the prediction task, such as logistic regression, random forest, or support vector machines. The selection is based on the problem requirements, dataset characteristics, and the desired trade-offs between model complexity and interpretability.

Model Training: The selected model is trained using the training dataset, with the input features and target variable.

Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated on the testing dataset to assess its performance. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed to measure the model's effectiveness in predicting strokes.

Model Fine-tuning: Hyperparameter tuning techniques, such as grid search or random search, may be applied to find the optimal set of hyperparameters for the chosen model. This process helps to improve the model's performance by fine-tuning its configuration.

Predictions: The fine-tuned model is used to make predictions on new, unseen data, or real-world instances to identify the likelihood of stroke occurrence in individuals
