Summary(Optional) :   This minor project was about the prediction that whether a person has a risk of heart disease or not depending on the various factors like age, sex, blood pressure, sugar, cholesterol, etc. At first, I found whether there is any missing value or duplicate value or not. Then, I performed where I tried to find any relation between various features and tried to evaluate the data further and proceeding with clearing some unnecessary data. Now, to predict the target variable I tried to found the best suitable model to make prediction, evaluating and fine tuning it to get the best results.
