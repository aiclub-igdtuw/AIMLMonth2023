Summary(Optional) :   The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 97.17% on the test data. The model performed well in predicting the majority class (0) with 98% accuracy but had a lower accuracy of 43% for the minority class (1), resulting in more false negatives. This indicates that the model struggles to correctly identify bankrupt companies. The F1-score for the minority class is 0.26, indicating a low performance in identifying bankrupt companies. The macro average F1-score of 0.62 suggests a moderate overall performance of the model. Examining the confusion matrix, the model misclassified 13 companies as bankrupt and 45 as non-bankrupt (false negatives). This implies that the model tends to incorrectly predict non-bankrupt companies as bankrupt more frequently.
