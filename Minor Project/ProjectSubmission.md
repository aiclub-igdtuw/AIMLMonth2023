Summary(Optional) :   In this project, I've merged the two datasets provided and then carried out various algorithms like classification, naive bayes, decision tree,and random forest classifier. Data pre-processing was done as there were duplicate entries that needed to be removed. The RandomForestClassifier had the highest accuracy of 92.96%.
