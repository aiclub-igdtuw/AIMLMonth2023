Summary(Optional) :  The purpose of this comprehensive approach is to assess and compare the performance of multiple classification algorithms in diagnosing fetal disease. By considering various algorithms and their respective parameters, the model aims to identify the most effective algorithm and its optimal settings for accurate classification. The visualization and analysis of the accuracy plots assist in understanding the relationship between different parameters and classification performance. Overall, this classification model serves as a valuable tool for healthcare professionals in predicting and diagnosing fetal health conditions, aiding in timely interventions and improved patient care.
