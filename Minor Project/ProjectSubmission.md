Summary(Optional) :   Objective:
The objective of this project is to perform regression analysis on the World Happiness dataset to explore the factors influencing happiness scores across different countries. The goal is to build a predictive model that identifies significant predictors and quantifies their impact on the happiness score.

Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is the World Happiness dataset available on Kaggle. It contains information about various factors and indicators of happiness across different countries. The dataset includes variables such as GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom, generosity, perceptions of corruption, and the happiness score.

Tasks and Key Findings:

Distribution of Happiness Scores:

Analyze the distribution of happiness scores in the dataset.
Understand how the happiness scores vary across different countries.
Correlation Analysis:

Calculate correlation coefficients between the happiness score and key variables (e.g., GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom, generosity, perceptions of corruption).
Identify the factors that are most strongly correlated with the happiness score.
Outlier Detection:

Identify outliers in variables like GDP per capita or healthy life expectancy.
Discuss the potential impact of these extreme values on the analysis and model performance.
Visualization of Social Support and Happiness Score:

Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between social support and the happiness score.
Determine if the relationship appears to be positive or negative.
Average Level of Freedom:

Calculate the mean freedom score across different countries.
Identify countries with high and low levels of freedom based on the mean freedom score.
The columns of interest are:

Life Ladder: the life evaluation used (to measure happiness) is the Cantril Ladder, which asks survey respondents to place the status of their lives on a “ladder” scale ranging from 0 to 10, where 0 means the worst possible life and 10 the best possible life

GDP per capita is in terms of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) adjusted to constant 2011 international dollars, taken from the World Development Indicators (WDI) released by the World Bank on November 14, 2018. See Statistical Appendix 1 for more details. GDP data for 2018 are not yet available, so we extend the GDP time series from 2017 to 2018 using countryspecific forecasts of real GDP growth from the OECD Economic Outlook No. 104 (Edition November 2018) and the World Bank’s Global Economic Prospects (Last Updated: 06/07/2018), after adjustment for population growth. The equation uses the natural log of GDP per capita, as this form fits the data significantly better than GDP per capita.


The time series of healthy life expectancy at birth are constructed based on data from the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Health Observatory data repository, with data available for 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2016.

Social support is the national average of the binary responses (either 0 or 1) to the Gallup World Poll (GWP) question “If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not?”

Freedom to make life choices is the national average of binary responses to the GWP question “Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?”

Generosity is the residual of regressing the national average of GWP responses to the question “Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?” on GDP per capita.

Perceptions of corruption are the average of binary answers to two GWP questions: “Is corruption widespread throughout the government or not?” and “Is corruption widespread within businesses or not?” Where data for government corruption are missing, the perception of business corruption is used as the overall corruption-perception measure.


Conclusion:


This project focuses on analyzing and predicting happiness scores based on various factors. Through descriptive analysis, correlation calculations, outlier detection, and visualization, we gain insights into the distribution of happiness scores, influential factors, outliers, and relationships between variables. The analysis contributes to understanding the complex dynamics of happiness and provides a foundation for developing a predictive model for happiness prediction.
