Summary(Optional) :   My project is mushroom classification, which mainly focuses on predicting the edibility of mushrooms. With the help of EDA, I got an insight into the dataset and the interrelation between all its columns, thus answering the 5 questions. Next, I did data preprocessing which includes transforming the categorical data into a numerical form suitable for machine learning algorithms. To handle the high dimensionality of the dataset which was 23, I applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) that helped in simplifying the dataset and reducing computational complexity. when it came to choosing model, I calculated the accuracy of all the possible models that were known to me which comes under classification. KNN gave the best accuracy out of all i.e. 99.75%. So further I continued with KNN only and used GridSearchCV for fine-tuning the model, which further increased the accuracy to 99.75%. Summary of the model's performance by evaluation metrics:
Accuracy: 99.75%
Precision: 99.61%
Recall: 99.87%
F1 score: 99.74%

NOTE: Since I used KNN, the model's performance is changing after every run, which I guess is normal, but the inferences I drew from the data remained the same, so I hope it is not a problem.
