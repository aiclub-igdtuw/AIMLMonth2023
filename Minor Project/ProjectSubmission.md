Summary(Optional) :   < The code gives us the prediction of a movie's success rate by training a linear regression model on a dataset, which includes factors like budget, popularity, vote average, and vote count.The model is trained by dividing the dataset into the testing and training sets and learning the connections between the input features and the target variable (revenue). Hence, the code can be used to estimate the success rate of new movies based on their features by training a linear regression model. >
