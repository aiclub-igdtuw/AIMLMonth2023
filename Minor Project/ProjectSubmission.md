Project Title     :  The problem is to perform analysis on the "Factors Affecting Campus Placement" dataset, which contains information about various factors that may 
                      influence the placement outcomes of students in a university campus. The objective is to understand the relationship between independent 
                        variables (such as gender, educational background, specialization, work experience, etc.) and the dependent variable (placement status) in 
                      order to build a predictive model.

Summary(Optional) :   Data preprocessing
                      Correlation analysis: This step involves calculating correlation coefficients between variables to identify relationships and patterns.
                      Interpretation and findings: positive correlation between academic performance and placement, or a negative correlation between certain 
                      specializations and placement.
