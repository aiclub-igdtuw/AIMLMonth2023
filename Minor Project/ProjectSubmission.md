Summary(Optional) :  In this AI/ML project, we will use a stroke prediction dataset to create a computer program that can predict stroke risks based on factors such as age, gender, BMI, smoking status, work type, marital status, residence type, hypertension, and heart disease. The program aims to help identify individuals who may be at a higher risk of having a stroke, improving early detection and prevention efforts.
