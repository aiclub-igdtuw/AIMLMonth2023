Summary(Optional) :   The minor project is based on the prediction of wind speed using the given dataset.Using seasonal and distribution plots this dataset tells about the variation of different weather variables during the months and years .Graphs showed uncertain wind pattern over years , high wind speed during the winter months ,high temperature in the summer season , low temperature in the winters etc which is quite evident. The accuracy of this model came out to be 12 percent or 0.12 which is very less and which shows that this dataset is not that good for predicting wind speed.Fine tuning the model increased the accuracy to 0.23 but still it is less.Thus,this dataset was successful in determining the wind speed but to a lesser accuracy.
