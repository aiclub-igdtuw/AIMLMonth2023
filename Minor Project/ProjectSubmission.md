Summary(Optional) :   I found relationship between the variables such as count of restaurants having online orders and how the table booking availability relates to the restaurant's rating.I found the accuracy of my model using mean squared error(MSE) which come out to be 0.22357188113632162. I analyzed the importance of different features in predicting the restaurant's rating.This helped to identify which factors have the most significant impact on the rating.

After fine-tuning the model:
Best Hyperparameters: {'max_depth': 20, 'min_samples_leaf': 1, 'min_samples_split': 2, 'n_estimators': 158}
Best Model Score: 0.6835131837848126
