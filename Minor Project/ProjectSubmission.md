Summary(Optional) :   < The Iris Flower Dataset project involved analyzing a dataset of Iris flowers. It included data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and correlation analysis. The features included sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Visualizations were used to understand feature distributions and relationships. The project identified high correlation between petal length and width. Box plots and violin plots were used to compare feature distributions across Iris species. Feature selection suggestions were made based on correlation with the target variable. Overall, the project provided insights into the dataset and its potential applications.

Three models were implemented on the dataset - Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forest. Out of the three, Logistic Regression gave an accuracy of 100% on the test set (alluding to a potential overfitting). Additionally, Random Forest gave an accuracy of 96%.
