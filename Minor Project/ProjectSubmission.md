Summary(Optional) :   As per the problem statement the problem was to identify whether a patient has breast cancer or not based on diagnostic measurements. The dataset contains features related to the mean radius, mean texture, mean perimeter, mean area, and mean smoothness of breast cells. The target variable is the diagnosis, which indicates whether the patient has breast cancer (1) or not (0). 

After exploring the data in task 1 and making the required refinements, in task 2, a **logistic regression model** has been build with accuracy around **93%**.
