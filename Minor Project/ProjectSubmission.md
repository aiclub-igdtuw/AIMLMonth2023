Summary(Optional) :   On performing Exploratory Data Analysis for employee attrition dataset, it was found out that the employees within the age group of 25-35 with low job satisfaction had left the organisation. The travelling distance was not the factor for them leaving the organisation. Classification has been performed on the dataset for the employees who have left and who have not. The Logistic Regression model has been used for classifying and it gives an accuracy of 84.18% on the train data and 82.65% on the test data.
