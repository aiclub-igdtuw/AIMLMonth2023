Summary(Optional) :   Given in the dataset are two CSV files, one containing details of all applicants and the other contains credit history of various users with a bank. Assuming that the applicants who have a credit history, got their credit cards and were the ones whose application for a credit card was approved, exploratory data analysis on this dataset has been performed. The approval rate of candidates was very low, less than 10% of the applicants' credit cards were approved. It was found that there was no significant difference between the rate of credit card approval based on the gender of the applicant; the same has been proved using a hypothesis test. The income distribution for the approved and rejected candidates was also very similar. 
A Logistic regression model to predict the approval status of an applicant's credit card given the necessary details, has been made with 99% accuracy after fine tuning and proper evaluation of the model. All the steps such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, label encoding among others have been carried out meticulously and orderly.
