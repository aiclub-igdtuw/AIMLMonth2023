Summary(Optional) :   I used the given Zomato dataset and performed the necessary exploratory data analysis techniques to analyse and read the data provided. After analysis, I have used the data to predict the approximate rating of the restaurant on the basis of factors like whether booking table option is available or not, the cost of the restaurant and votes.
For prediction, I have used linear regression and trained the model accordingly. The predictions made by the model are almost equal to the actual ratings.
