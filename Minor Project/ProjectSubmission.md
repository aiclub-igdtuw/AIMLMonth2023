Summary(Optional) :   This project deals with predicting diabetes in individuals from Pima Indian women. It compares and finds correlation between individuals with or without diabetes and how this diabetes can be affected by various independent factors like Glucose levels, Blood Pressure, BMI, Insulin etc. Here, I have created a predictive model using Logistic Regression classifier, that shows that this dataset has an accuracy of 74%.
