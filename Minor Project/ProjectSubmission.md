Summary(Optional) :   The mechanical tools classification dataset consists of over 10,000 images of 28 different mechanical tools. Each image is labeled with the corresponding tool name. The dataset was created to help researchers and developers build machine learning models that can accurately identify and classify mechanical tools. The dataset can be used for a variety of applications, such as robotics, automation, and manufacturing. The purpose of the dataset is to help train machine learning models to recognize and classify these tools accurately. This dataset takes into consideration the image classification technqiues and identifying the properties of images of tools.
