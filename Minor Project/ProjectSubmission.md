Summary(Optional) :   For my minor project, I did EDA and regression on the World Happiness Prediction dataset. As per my EDA, out of all the regions, Western Europe had the highest and Sub-Saharan Africa had the lowest happiness score. On the basis of country, Switzerland had the highest and Togo had the lowest happiness score. The dataset has some outliers as well in Family, Generosity and Trust. Finally, I could see a positive correlation between social support and happiness score. Post the EDA, I used multivariate polynomial regression to create a prediction model. I additionally fine-tuned it by finding out the degree at which mean squared error would be the least.
