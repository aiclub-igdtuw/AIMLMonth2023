Summary(Optional) :   < The Powerball project uses EDA and time series analysis to identify patterns in the Powerball winning numbers dataset. The project has found that certain numbers appear more frequently in the dataset than others, and that the winning numbers tend to cluster together. The Prophet model has been able to make accurate predictions for future drawings, suggesting that there is some value in using EDA and time series analysis to analyze the Powerball winning numbers dataset. >
