Summary(Optional) :   In this AI/ML project, we used the given dataset to create an ML based program that can help predict if someone is at risk of having a stroke. We analysed various factors such as age, gender, BMI, smoking status, work type, marital status, residence type, hypertension, and heart disease and tried to identify patterns that indicate a higher chance of experiencing a stroke.
