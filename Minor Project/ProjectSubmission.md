Summary(Optional) :  
        - This project involves analyzing the Powerball winning numbers dataset to identify hidden trends and patterns.
        - Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques are used to uncover these trends.
        - Data visualizations such as line plots, heat maps, and distribution plots are employed to visualize the data.
        - The dataset is analyzed using techniques like frequency analysis.
        - The Facebook Prophet model is used for time series analysis and predicting future winning numbers.
        - The performance of the Prophet model is evaluated using metrics like MAE, MSE, and RMSE.
        - The project aims to provide insights into the characteristics of the luckiest numbers in the Powerball lottery.
        
        - By leveraging EDA and time series analysis, patterns and trends in the winning numbers can be identified, potentially leading             to improved predictions for future drawings.
