Summary(Optional) :   < evaluation metrics suggest that the model performs well in predicting body fat percentages. The low values of MAE and MSE indicate that the model's predictions are generally close to the actual values. Additionally, the high R-squared value suggests that the model captures a significant amount of the variation in the target variable. >
