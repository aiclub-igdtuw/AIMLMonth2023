Summary(Optional) :   The problem statement i worked upon was to find the performance of the restraunt based on its ratings. So i created a new column and assigned 1 for ratings more than or equal to 3.5 & 0 for ratings less than 3.5. Since it was a classifier problem I chose to go with Logistic Regression.
