                      Based on these findings, it can be concluded that the selected features have a meaningful impact on happiness levels. Factors such as economic                        prosperity (GDP per capita), social support, health, freedom, generosity, and perceived corruption influence overall happiness. However, it is                        important to note that this model's accuracy and findings are specific to the dataset and methodology employed.
