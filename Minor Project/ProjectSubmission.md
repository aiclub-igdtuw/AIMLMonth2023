Summary(Optional) :- 
Weather Data Analysis using Machine Learning (AIMLMonth2023 - Minor Project )

Description
This project involves the analysis of historical weather data using machine learning techniques. The goal is to explore the patterns, trends, and relationships within the weather dataset and develop analytic model for temperature and precipitation.

Dependencies and Setup
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Code Structure
- data_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis code
- KCLT.csv: The weather dataset in CSV format

Dataset Description
The weather data is sourced from the US weather history and is provided in a CSV format. The dataset includes the following columns:

- date
- actual_mean_temp
- actual_min_temp
- actual_max_temp
- average_min_temp
- average_max_temp
- record_min_temp
- record_max_temp
- record_min_temp_year
- record_max_temp_year
- actual_precipitation
- average_precipitation
- record_precipitation

Analysis Methodology
The analysis includes the following steps:
   - Data loading and preprocessing
   - Exploratory data analysis
   - Visual representation and selection
   - Results and Insights
  
The analysis reveals various insights, including:
    - Correlations between different weather variables
    - Seasonal patterns in temperature and precipitation
