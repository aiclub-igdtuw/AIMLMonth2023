Summary(Optional) :   
Mushroom hunting, also known as "shrooming," has seen a surge in popularity recently. To gain insights into the classification of mushrooms as either poisonous or edible, I conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) using a Mushroom classification dataset sourced from the Kaggle website. By thoroughly analyzing the dataset, I aimed to uncover patterns and relationships that could aid in distinguishing between the two classes of mushrooms.

Following the EDA, I proceeded to develop a classification model to predict the class of mushrooms. Given the nature of the problem as a classification task, I opted to utilize the Decision Tree algorithm.
Using the Decision Tree algorithm, I trained the model on the dataset, taking into account various features such as stalk shape, stalk root, and stalk surface characteristics.
This study provides valuable insights for mushroom enthusiasts and helps ensure their safety by accurately distinguishing between edible and poisonous mushrooms.
