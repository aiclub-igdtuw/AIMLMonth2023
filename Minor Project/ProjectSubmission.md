Summary(Optional) :   <This is a model to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not based on the given dataset. The dataset contains various features related to the patient's age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiogram results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, oldpeak (ST depression), and the slope of the peak exercise ST segment. I have used logistic regression in this and got score for my train data as '0.842' and for the test data it is 0.852>
