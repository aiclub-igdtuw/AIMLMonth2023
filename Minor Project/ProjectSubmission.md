Summary(Optional) :   The main objective of this dataset is to classify the Iris flowers into their respective species based on the given feature measurements. It serves as a typical example of a classification problem in machine learning. The dataset is well-structured and does not contain any missing values or outliers, making it suitable for analysis and modeling. The features exhibit distinct variations across the three species, providing meaningful information for classification tasks. An accuracy of nearly 98% suggests that the logistic regression model is quite effective in capturing the patterns and relationships between the features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and the target variable (species) in the Iris dataset.
