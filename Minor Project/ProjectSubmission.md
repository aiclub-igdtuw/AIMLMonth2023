Summary(Optional) :  The project involves predicting the quality of red variants of Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine based on physicochemical tests and sensory data. The dataset contains input variables such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol. The output variable is the quality of wine, represented by a score between 0 and 10.The problem is approached as a regression analysis task, aiming to build a predictive model for wine quality. The dataset is described as having fewer samples and being highly imbalanced, which presents challenges for the analysis.
