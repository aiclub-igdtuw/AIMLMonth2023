Summary(Optional) :  Heart Attack Analysis and Prediction dataset composed of both categorical and continous data. It consisted of individual health profile of different people belonging from different age group and gender. It also provided us some details about factors that are important, when it comes to heart disease. EDA on the given dataset, helped me come to some conclusions: The chances of having a heart attack varies, when we analyse different age groups and gender. Males have more chances of having a heart attack than females. Various factors such as cholestoral and resting blood sugar cannot accurately predict the chances of a heart attack. Logistic Regression model is used predict the chances of a heart attack in the above dataset. The model gave an accuracy of almost 85% on the training data and almost 90% on the test data.
