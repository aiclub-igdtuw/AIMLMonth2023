Summary(Optional) :   The problem is to perform analysis on the "Disease Burden by Cause" dataset, which contains information about the disease burden caused by various factors in different countries from 1990 to 2019. The objective is to explore the relationship between independent variables (such as risk factors, causes, and demographic factors) and the dependent variable (disease burden) in order to build a predictive model.
