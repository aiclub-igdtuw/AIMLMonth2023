Summary(Optional) :   < In this machine learning project, the main objective was to develop a model for predicting
the quality of red wines.The dataset used for training and evaluation consisted of various physicochemical properties of different red wines, along with their corresponding quality ratings.The results obtained from the project demonstrated that the developed machine learning model could effectively predict the quality of red wines based on the given physicochemical properties. >
