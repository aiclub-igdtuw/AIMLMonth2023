Summary(Optional) :    The arm-like structure of an industrial robot is known as a robot manipulator. This component is responsible for completing the tasks the robot is programmed to perform. Also known as a robot arm, the manipulator mounts to the robot body and consists of multiple links and joints. The data is generated by uniformely randomly generating values of joints within possible ranges for each of the six joints of the robotic manipulator - in radians. With these values generated, the direct kinematic equations are used to determine the x, y, and z coordinate for the given joint coordinates. Build a regression model (maybe based on some Neural Network algorithm) for dependent variables (x, y and z) from independent variables (q1..q6)
