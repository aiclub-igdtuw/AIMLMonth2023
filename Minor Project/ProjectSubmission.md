Summary(Optional) :   In this project, we worked with a dataset containing financial data of various companies named 'Company Bankruptcy Pediction'. The goal of the project was to predict bankruptcy using machine learning techniques. the project involved several steps , includind data processing, model evaluation, feauture scaling, fine tuning the model. We also performed exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and understand the relationship between different variables. We visualized the data using scatter plots, count plots, and other types of plots to identify any patterns or trends. For model selection, we considered several algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Multinomial Naive Bayes. We evaluated each model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Finally, we evaluated the selected model using the testing set and calculated metrics to assess its performance.
