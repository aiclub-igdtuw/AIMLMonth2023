Summary(Optional) :   In this project, I have discussed how other factors like age, gender, residential area type, work type, heart diseases, hypertension, etc are related with stroke prediction. I have used many libraries like numpy,pandas, matplotlib, scikit learn, to properly analyse the dataset. I have made various types of graphs, correlation matrices to find the prominent factors which are strongly or weakly related with stroke prediction.The accuracy of the model is coming out 92%. I have written all my observations in my notebook after every task I've performed on my dataset.
