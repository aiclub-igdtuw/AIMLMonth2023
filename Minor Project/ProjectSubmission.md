Summary(Optional) :   < Mushroom hunting or shrooming is in demand nowadays and through this dataset analysis we have analysed the categorical i.e. ediblepoisonous or posionous features along with other features like cap-shape, cap-color, cap-surface etc. We have also determined the certainty of our model using KNeighborsClassifier. Also determined the relationship among different attributes of the data. We have performed classification analysis and determined the certainty of our model, by performing preprocessing, splitting the data, and training the model and  then printing the accuracy report which came out to be 96% >
