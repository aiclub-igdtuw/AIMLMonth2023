Summary(Optional) :   

In this project, we worked with a dataset containing financial data of various companies named 'Company Bankruptcy Pediction'. The goal of the project was to predict bankruptcy using machine learning techniques. 

The project involved several steps, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature scaling, model selection, model evaluation, and fine-tuning the model. During data preprocessing, we handled missing values, performed feature scaling to ensure all features were on a similar scale, and split the dataset into training and testing sets. 

We also performed exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and understand the relationship between different variables. We visualized the data using scatter plots, count plots, and other types of plots to identify any patterns or trends. 

For model selection, we considered several algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Multinomial Naive Bayes. We evaluated each model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. To fine-tune the model, we used techniques like grid search and cross-validation to find the optimal hyperparameters for each algorithm. This involved testing different parameter combinations to identify the best-performing model. 

Finally, we evaluated the selected model using the testing set and calculated metrics to assess its performance. We achieved high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, indicating that the model performed well in predicting bankruptcy.

Overall, this project involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model selection, and model evaluation to build a predictive model for bankruptcy classification using financial data.
